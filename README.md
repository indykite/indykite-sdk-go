## Documentation

Visit the IndyKite One Developer Community site for official
[IndyKite documentation](https://indykite.one/blog?category=5e3e9297-3451-4b52-91ee-8027dcd1789c)
and to find out how to use the entire platform for your project.

## Getting Started

### Trial

For a trial please contact [IndyKite](https://www.indykite.com/contact-us)
to setup and configure the platform.

## Initial settings

1. You need to have a configuration json file to be able to use the Jarvis Proto SDK. You can get it from your
   Indykite contact or from Indykite console if you have access to it.

   Example configuration file:

```json
{
  "appSpaceId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-010100000002",
  "baseUrl": "https://jarvis.indykite.com",
  "applicationId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-020100000002",
  "defaultTenantId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-030100000002",
  "appAgentId": "696e6479-6b69-4465-8000-050100000002",
  "endpoint": "jarvis.indykite.com",
  "privateKeyJWK": {
    "kty": "EC",
    "d": "aa",
    "use": "sig",
    "crv": "P-256",
    "kid": "2e5lIxxb6obIwpok",
    "x": "6d83se2Eg",
    "y": "lshzMo",
    "alg": "ES256"
  },
  "privateKeyPKCS8Base64": "LS0tLS==",
  "privateKeyPKCS8": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nM\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```

Conditionally optional parameters:

- baseUrl
- defaultTenantId
- endpoint

1. You have two choices to set up the necessary credentials. You either pass the json to the `INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
   environment variable or set the `INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable to the configuration file's path.

   1. on Linux and OSX

      ```shell
      export INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='{"appSpaceId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000000","appAgentId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000001","endpoint": "application.indykite.com","privateKeyJWK":{"kty":"EC","d": "abcdef","use": "sig","crv": "P-256","kid":"efghij","x":"klmnop","y":"qrstvw","alg":"ES256"}}'`
      ```

      or

      ```shell
      export INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/Users/xx/configuration.json
      ```

   1. on Windows command line

      ```shell
      setex INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='{"appSpaceId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000000","appAgentId":"00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000001","endpoint": "application.indykite.com","privateKeyJWK":{"kty":"EC","d": "abcdef","use": "sig","crv": "P-256","kid":"efghij","x":"klmnop","y":"qrstvw","alg":"ES256"}}'`
      ```

      or

      ```shell
      setex INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE "C:\Users\xx\Documents\configuration.json"
      ```
